# MyTunes LandingPage
 This is my first project in the area of the Landing page... All the code is from the video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJXXf3_dcng&t=936s  of the Traversy Media Channel (The best)

Your Channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA (Highly Recomended) Thanks a lot  I´m improving a lot with your videos... 

Important to say: I´m typing all the code from the scratch just to learn how to works everyting about HTML and CSS (My best way to learn), in a future with more experience I have in mind to add some implementations to these projects (My personal brand or bussines)  

IMPORTANT DATE: 19 Sep 2021 -> I have Finished the project succefully, in mode of reflection I´ve learned a lot of things like utilies class, responsive design, adding icons and other stuffs about image designs. 
Just to finish I really hope to keep going on this path of self learning and cominng soon be capable to create or make some cool implementations to these projects...
